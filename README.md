# Electronic Vaccine Analysis framework, EVA

EVA is a tool for creating vaccination analysis and forecasting software.  It has a complete framework that understands vaccines and all that's required to add/modify vaccination rules is to enter the specific information about a vaccine.  It is designed to be maintained by people with pediatric knowledge, rather than programming knowledge.

The system is implemented using Amzi! ARulesXL software.  All of the data and tables and rules are entered in spreadsheet cells.  They can be developed and tested in the Excel environment, which supports a database of test cases that can be used for regression testing as rules change.

Once the knowledge is working as desired, the knowledge base can be exported into a format that can be easily integrated into any other application development environment, such as Java, .NET or Delphi.

EVA is the basis of the vaccination knowledge used in Office Practicum, pediatric software that consistently wins benchmark tests for having the best vaccination forecasting and analysis.  This is because it can easily model missing schedules, complex interactions, and vaccine heirarchies.

See the documentation for details, and don't hesitate to contact me if you're interested in using this software.
